## Debug Instructions

**1. Restart Kayod Server:**
```bash
cd C:\Users\melvi\Documents\GitHub\kayod\server
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
npm start
```

**2. Try using your main Kayod app again** (the one giving 401 errors)
   - Look at the server console for detailed authentication logs
   - The logs will show exactly what's happening with the JWT tokens

**3. Test KayodManage connection:**
```bash
cd C:\Users\melvi\Documents\GitHub\KayodManage\Backend
pnpm run test-connection
```

**4. What to look for in the logs:**

**For regular Kayod app users (should work):**
```
🔐 Auth middleware - Path: /credential-verification/status/68ae59e..., Method: GET
🎫 Checking for JWT token...
   Cookies: ['auth_token']
🍪 Token from cookie: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...
🔍 Verifying JWT token...
✅ Token decoded - User ID: 68ae59e68618d0595d5b33ad
✅ User authenticated: John Doe
```

**For KayodManage API calls (should work):**
```
🔐 Auth middleware - Path: /credential-verification/admin/all, Method: GET
🔑 API key provided: kayod-admi...
✅ Valid API key - admin access granted
```

**5. Share the console output** so I can see exactly where the authentication is failing.

The debugging will tell us:
- ❌ If JWT tokens are missing
- ❌ If JWT verification is failing  
- ❌ If users aren't found in database
- ❌ If there's a JWT secret mismatch
- ✅ If everything is working correctly
