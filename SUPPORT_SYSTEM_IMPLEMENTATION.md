## 🚀 How to Test the Implementation

### Prerequisites
1. Install Socket.IO client in admin frontend:
   ```bash
   cd Frontend
   npm install socket.io-client
   ```

2. Make sure both servers are running with the new routes

### Testing Flow

#### 1. User Creates Ticket (Mobile App)
1. Open mobile app → Help Center → Contact Support
2. Fill out the form with:
   - Title: "Test payment issue"
   - Category: "Payment Issues" 
   - Priority: "High"
   - Description: "Having trouble with wallet top-up"
3. Submit the ticket
4. Navigate to "View My Support Tickets" to see the created ticket

#### 2. Admin Receives Ticket (Admin Panel)
1. Open admin panel → Support (new sidebar item)
2. See the new ticket in "Pending" status
3. Click on the ticket to view details
4. Click "Accept" to accept the ticket

#### 3. Real-time Chat
1. **Mobile**: Ticket status changes to "Accepted", chat interface appears
2. **Admin**: Can now send messages in the chat interface
3. **Both**: Messages appear in real-time on both sides

#### 4. Resolution Process
1. **Admin**: Click "Mark Resolved" and provide resolution summary
2. **Mobile**: User sees resolved status and rating interface
3. **User**: Can rate the support experience (1-5 stars) and provide feedback

### Sample Test Data
```javascript
// Sample ticket creation from mobile app
{
  "title": "Wallet top-up failed",
  "description": "I tried to top up my wallet with GCash but the payment failed after deduction",
  "category": "payment",
  "priority": "high"
}
```

## 📱 User Experience Flow

### For Users (Mobile App)
1. **Help Center** → **Contact Support** → Fill form → Submit
2. **My Tickets** → View ticket status and chat history
3. **Ticket Detail** → Real-time chat with admin (when accepted)
4. **Rating** → Rate support experience when resolved

### For Admins (Web Panel)
1. **Support** → View all tickets with filters and search
2. **Ticket Detail** → Accept/reject tickets and manage conversations
3. **Chat Interface** → Real-time communication with users
4. **Resolution** → Mark tickets as resolved with summary

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
No additional environment variables needed, but ensure existing Socket.IO and database connections are working.
